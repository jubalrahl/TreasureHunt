You can run your jar file by creating a batch file. First open a blank notepad file and paste this into it:
@echo off
cmd /k java -jar TreasureHunt.jar

Save it as launcher.bat and file type All Files. That will make it an executable batch file. Double clicking on it will run the jar file
so long as they are both in the same folder.
